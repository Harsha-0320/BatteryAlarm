It is an Android Mobile Application, alerting the user about mobile battery status while on charge but going off when the battery level recahes certain battery limit set by the user. 
It provides the user a choice to select the limit for high level battery alarm. 
The only condition for the app is that it has to be kept running in the background only for the alarm to go off. 
After clicking stop the app will stop running. It is very simple to use and easy to understand.
